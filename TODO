- make *default-pathname-defaults* buffer local

- per buffer mode line

- isearch
  - When typing wrong characters in isearch they are appended to the *isearch-string*. 
    They should be just discarded 
  - Show current search string in minibuffer

- repl window, so we can have some output scrollback (requires buffer-stream I think)
- replace-string, query-replace, replace-regexp
- search for regex
- show-paren-mode like paren matching by bolding the matching paren
- auto indentation (basic electric newline?)
   
- create *Messages* buffer
  - create a stream type that will write to a buffer (buffer-stream)
    -  https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl/blob/master/doc/manual/gray-streams-examples.texinfo
      
- create a proper minibuffer area for displaying messages and getting input
  - curently the title contains some of what would be in a mode-line

- undo
- color highlighting (hard, might want to just use italic/bold for keywords at first)
- file completion during C-x C-f
- symbol completion during M-: 
- jump/pop to/from source M-./M-* (see compiler for adding line/file information)
- 'hippy' symbol completion M-/

- Encoding BUG: saving gui/compositor.c caused some sort of encoding problem with
  the pound symbol and another one. had to revert using git. also happens on 
   copywrite symbol in the README.
