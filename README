med - Mezzano EDitor
----------------------

med is a fork of the original editor that comes with Mezzano, a 
Common Lisp operating system.  The original editor is not so good 
at handling large files, so initially this fork broke the one big 
file it was written in into smaller ones for easier development.

Original Mezzano editor.lisp code written by Henry Harrington.

TODO:

- why does everything slow to a crawl after some time?

- optimize or cache (memoize?) buffer current package so we can put
  the current file package in the modeline properly

- isearch
  - When typing wrong characters in isearch they are appended to the *isearch-string*. 
    They should be just discarded 
  - Show current search string in minibuffer

- repl window, so we can have some output scrollback (requires buffer-stream I think)
- replace-string, query-replace, replace-regexp
- search for regex
- show-paren-mode like paren matching by bolding the matching paren
  - added character attributes
  - make redisplay render with bold font if :BOLD is set in the character attributes
- auto indentation (basic electric newline?)
   
- undo
- color highlighting (hard, might want to just use italic/bold for keywords at first)
- file completion during C-x C-f
- symbol completion during M-: 
- jump/pop to/from source M-./M-* (see compiler for adding line/file information)
- 'hippy' symbol completion M-/

- Encoding BUG: saving gui/compositor.c caused some sort of encoding problem with
  the pound symbol and another one. had to revert using git. also happens on 
   copywrite symbol in the README.
