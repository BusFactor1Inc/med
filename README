me - A Mezzano Editor
---------------------

me is a fork of the editor that comes with Mezzano, a Common Lisp
operating system.  The original editor is not so good at handling
large files, so initially this fork broke the one big file it was
written in into many small ones for easier development.

Original editor.lisp code written by Henry Harrington.
